# William Mitro Interview App

### Running the app

Navigate to the project via cmd and then run "mvn spring-boot:run"   
or  
Run it directly out of IntelliJ

### Notes

Nothing really special happening in the code since it is such a small app. I made use of some Spring Boot stuff like
annotations
and basic application layout. I also used a custom formatter. Happy to answer any specific questions.
